# Scraper
A simple application written in Python to scrape product information from  [this](https://dentalstall.com/shop/) website. The implementation uses [Fast API](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as the web framework and [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for parsing the HTML. The parsed content is stored on the local filesystem.
